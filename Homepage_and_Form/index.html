					<h1>Environmental Science <bdo dir="rtl">Environmental Science</bdo> </h1>
					<p><b><i>Environmental science</b></i> is a multidisciplinary academic field that integrates physical, 
					biological and information sciences (including but not limited to ecology, physics, chemistry, zoology, mineralogy,
					oceanology, limnology, soil science, geology, atmospheric science, geography and geodesy) to the study of the environment,
					and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary 
					approach to the study of environmental systems.[1] <br/><br/>
					
					The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.

					<strong>Related areas of study </strong>include environmental studies and environmental engineering. Environmental studies incorporates more 
					of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental 
					engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect. Environmental scientists work 
					on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, 
					natural resource management, and the effects of global climate change. Environmental issues almost always include an interaction
					of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental 
					problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well 
					as quantitative analysis. </p>

					<p><pre>Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) 
					the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental 
					laws requiring specific <small>environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in 
					addressing environmental problems.</small> Events that spurred this development included the publication of Rachael Carson's landmark 
					<big>environmental book Silent Spring[2]</big> along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the 1969 Santa Barbara 
					oil spill, and the Cuyahoga River of Cleveland, Ohio, "catching fire" (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of 
					environmental issues and create this new field of study.</pre> </p>
